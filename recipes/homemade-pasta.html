        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The traditional Italian dish. Pasta is typically made from unleavened dough of flour mixed with eggs. Pasta noodles come in many shapes and sizes, and can be completed with many different types of sauce, making it one of the most varied dishes.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Prepare the drys</li>
            <p>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together flour and salt.</p>

            <li>Step 2: Wet the drys</li>
            <p>Add eggs into the flour and whisk to combine. This will form a very soft dough</p>

            <li>Step 3: Knead the dough</li>
            <p>Move the dough to a clean counter coated in a thin layer of flour. Fold the dough over itself repeatedly. The dough will firm up. Begin kneading the dough. Use a knife to periodically cut the dough to check for air bubbles. The dough is ready when there are very few air bubbles.</p>

            <li>Step 4: Rest the dough</li>
            <p>Return dough to clean mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Rest dough for at least 30 minutes.</p>

            <li>Step 5: Divide the dough</li>
            <p>Sprinkle baking sheet with flour. Place the dough on the baking sheet and divide in to four equal parts. Sprinkle the dough with flour.</p>

            <li> Step 6: Roll the dough</li>
            <p>Set pasta maker to thickest setting. Flatten one section of dough by hand and feed through pasta maker. Regularly sprinkle flour on dough to prevent sticking. Repeat feeding dough through pasta maker until smooth.</p>

            <li>Step 7: Thin the pasta</li>
            <p>Change the settings gradually on the pasta maker to make dough as thin as desired.</p>

            <li>Step 8: Cut the pasta</li>
            <p>Run the pasta through the pasta maker with the desired cutter attachment.</p>

            <li>Step 9: Dry the wets</li>
            <p>Hang and air dry pasta on a clothes drying rack or coat hangers to let air dry until brittle</p>

            <li>Step 10: Wet the drys</li>
            <p>When preparing pasta for a meal, prepare a pot of boiling water (add salt to taste). Cook pasta in boiling water until al dente.</p>

            <li>Step 11: Dry the wets</li>
            <p>Strain pasta in colander to remove excess water.</p>

            <li>Step 12: Wet the drys</li>
            <p>Return pasta to cooking pot and add desired pasta sauce.</p>

            <li>Step 13: Serve and enjoy</li>
            <p>Add spices and seasonings as desired. Enjoy!</p>
